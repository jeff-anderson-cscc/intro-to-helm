# Getting Started With Helm

## Installing Helm

The quick and easy way:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

For alternatives and details, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm documentation.


## Finding Charts

`helm search hub` searches the [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/) for charts from a wide array of providers. For example, to find a chart for the [Drupal content management system (CMS)](https://www.drupal.org/)

```
helm search hub drupal
```
Returns:
```
URL                                               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                                       
https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami-ak...	11.0.19      	9.3.8      	Drupal is one of the most versatile open source...

https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cetic/drupal 	0.1.0        	1.16.0     	Drupal is a free and open-source web content ma...
```

To widen the columns, use `--max-col-width` plus a number for how wide you want the columns to be:

```
helm search hub drupal --max-col-width 65
```
Returns:
```
URL                                                    	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION

### Security tip:

Like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), anyone can publish anything to [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/). When searching for charts, always start by filtering on "official" charts where the chart publisher owns the software deployed by the packages. If the software you need is not available from an official source, try "verified publishers". While it is no guarantee of quality and security, official and verified publishers are generally more trustworthy. 

Regardless of the source, you can (and should) examine the manifests produced by a chart before using it by using the `--dry-run` option with `helm install`.

## Adding a repo

Drupal is available from verified publisher [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/) which is now part of VMware. A handful of Bitnami developers were among the core contributors who designed the Helm repository system. They have contributed to the establishment of Helmâ€™s best practices for chart development and have written many of the most widely used charts.<sup>1</sup>

Let's add Bitnami to our local repository list using the information from the [Artifact Hub Bitnami Drupal](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/drupal) page.

```
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

To verify the result:
```
helm repo list
```

## Searching the Repo

```
helm search repo drupal
```
